        In compliance with the Federal labeling and record keeping law United States Code,
        <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/18-usc-2257-2257a-certifications">Title 18, Section 2257</a>, all
        models and other persons who appear in any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct appearing or otherwise
        contained in or at any merchant owned website were over the age of eighteen years at the time of the creation of
        such depictions. All content and images are in full compliance with the requirements of United States Code,
        <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/18-usc-2257-2257a-certifications">Title 18, Section 2257</a>
        and associated regulations and
        <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0093">EU regulations</a>. All other
        visual depictions displayed on this website are exempt from the provision of 18
        U.S.C. section 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 and
        <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0093">EU regulations</a>, because they
        do not portray conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.0 section 2256 (2) (A) through (D), but are merely
        depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise
        exempt because the visual depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995.
