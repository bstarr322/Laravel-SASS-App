        This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website
        (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”). “Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a

        purposes.
        Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more
        convenient.
        A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the
        cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Site
        regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not. Like most websites, we use cookies for a
        variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but
        specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.</b> Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website. For
        example,

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2</b>. Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website. For example, we
        may store

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3</b>. Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing
        purposes.
        These Cookies allow us to display Beautiesfromheaven promotional material to you on other sites you visit
        across
        the Internet. Beautiesfromheaven may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third
        parties
        (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted

    <p>
        <b>4</b>. Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that
        referred the

        website.
        These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website, or

    <p>
        Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on
        the
        lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our
        Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal
        data).
        We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to
        help
        customize your Indeed web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those
        instances. Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set
        your
        browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed
        in
        the cookie folder of your browser.
